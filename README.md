# Simple crawler and scraper

A simple python code that queues urls for the same website and then scraps its textual content
This code was used to acquire data for a NLP project

I grabbed code portions from these websites :
- [Web Data Crawling vs Web Data Scraping](https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/data-scraping-vs-data-crawling/)
- [How to scrape only visible webpage text with BeautifulSoup?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1936466/how-to-scrape-only-visible-webpage-text-with-beautifulsoup)
